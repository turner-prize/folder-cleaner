Sorts out a messy TV show folder!

if you have a ton of downloaded TV shows all in the original folders you downloaded them in, this will sort them out. As long as there is the show name and S01E01 (or whatever season/ep) then it will extract the files, rename, delete any .txt or screenshot files, and then create a specific folder for the show, and another one inside for the season.

Restrictions: If your show does not have the S01E01 tag somewhere in the file name, the file won't be able to be renamed properly.
              If you have slightly different show naming conventions in your downloads, e.g. brooklyn nine nine and brooklyn nine-nine then               this will seperate into two seperate folders.
